They are innocent, child-like questions, but they bring about catastrophic answers. People who are set in their ways for generations, are forced to reappraise their world when they see it from PK`s innocent eyes. In the process PK makes loyal friends and powerful foes. Mends broken lives and angers the establishment. PK`s childlike curiosity transforms into a spiritual odyssey for him and millions of others. The film is an ambitious and uniquely original exploration of complex philosophies. It is also a simple and humane tale of love, laughter and letting go. Finally, it is a moving saga about a friendship between strangers from worlds apart.",
